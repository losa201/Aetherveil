# Aetherveil Sentinel

An autonomous, cloud-native, LLM-driven cybersecurity organism for advanced red team operations, bug bounty automation, and OSINT intelligence.

## Features

- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-healing, self-learning swarm intelligence
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for GCP deployment with Cloud Run
- **LLM-Driven**: Advanced prompt engineering for intelligent decision making
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Adaptive tactics through PPO/A3C algorithms
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j-powered attack path analysis
- **Stealth Operations**: Advanced evasion and anti-detection techniques
- **OSINT Intelligence**: Comprehensive data gathering and threat attribution

## Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python coordinator/app.py
```

### GCP Deployment
```bash
./deployment/deploy.sh --gcp --region europe-west1
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Run red team operation
python3 coordinator/app.py --workflow stealth_exploit

# Query knowledge graph
curl -X POST /query -d 'MATCH (n) RETURN n'

# Generate report
python3 coordinator/report.py --output engagement.pdf
```

## Architecture
